Hi, I’m Shreya

I’m a Business / Systems Analyst with a background in computer science and business analytics.
I work with data, reports, and system-level information to support analysis and decision-making.

My experience includes analytics projects, QA-focused application work, and system/event data analysis.
I’m most comfortable working with SQL, Power BI, Excel, and documentation-heavy workflows where accuracy, validation, and clarity matter.

I also have formal training in cybersecurity, which helps me better understand systems, controls, and data integrity when working with logs and operational data.
